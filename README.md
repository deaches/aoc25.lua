Advent of Code 2025: Lua Edition
================================

[This year's challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2025) will only have
[twelve days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twelve_Days_of_Christmas_(song))
to save Christmas rather than the traditional twenty-five.
Sadly, this is no longer technically an advent calendar.
